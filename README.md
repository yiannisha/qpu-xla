# qpu-xla: a QPU-based aXelerated Linear Algebra library
This is an XLA meant to be used on Raspberry Pi's utilizing the QPU of the VideoCore chip.

The scope of this library is both an XLA (basic math operators) AND an ML inference (basic ML operators + inference engine) library.

# py-videocore7

A Python library for GPGPU programming on Raspberry Pi 5, which realizes
assembling and running QPU programs.

For Raspberry Pi Zero/1/2/3, use
[Idein/py-videocore](https://github.com/Idein/py-videocore) instead.

For Raspberry Pi 4, use
[Idein/py-videocore6](https://github.com/Idein/py-videocore6) instead.

## About VideoCore VII QPU

Raspberry Pi 5 (BCM2712) has a GPU named VideoCore VII QPU in its SoC.
The basic instruction set (add/mul ALU dual issue, three delay slots et al.)
remains the same as VideoCore VI QPU of Raspberry Pi 4, and some units
now perform differently.

- VideoCore IV QPU @ 250MHz: 250 [MHz] x 3 [slice] x 4 [qpu/slice] x 4 [physical core/qpu] x 2 [op/cycle] = 24 [Gflop/s]
- VideoCore IV QPU @ 300MHz: 300 [MHz] x 3 [slice] x 4 [qpu/slice] x 4 [physical core/qpu] x 2 [op/cycle] = 28.8 [Gflop/s]
- VideoCore VI QPU @ 500MHz: 500 [MHz] x 2 [slice] x 4 [qpu/slice] x 4 [physical core/qpu] x 2 [op/cycle] = 32 [Gflop/s]
- VideoCore VII QPU @ 800MHz: 800 [MHz] x 3 [slice] x 4 [qpu/slice] x 4 [physical core/qpu] x 2 [op/cycle] = 76.8 [Gflop/s]


## Requirements

`py-videocore7` communicates with the V3D hardware through `/dev/dri/card0`,
which is exposed by the DRM V3D driver.
To access the device, you need to belong to `video` group or be `root` user.
If you choose the former, run `sudo usermod --append --groups video $USER`
(re-login to take effect).


## Installation

[Install `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and
clone `py-videocore7` and run with `uv`:

```console
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/Idein/py-videocore7.git
$ cd py-videocore7/
$ uv run examples/sgemm.py
```


## Running tests and examples

In the `py-videocore7` directory cloned above:

```console
$ uv run pytest -vs tests
```

```console
$ uv run examples/sgemm.py
